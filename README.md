# V2
In high-resolution aerial images, due to the low feature density and small pixels of the objects to be detected, it is difficult to capture subtle details during feature extraction, which can easily lead to missed detections and false detections.To address this problem, this paper proposes a small object detection algorithm inspired by the information processing mechanism of visual area V2, in order to improve the networkâ€™s ability to extract detailed features such as the edge and direction of small objects.Inspired by the information processing mechanism of complex cells and hypercomplex cells in biological visual area V2, we designed a complex cell module (CCM) that mimics the edge-sensitive properties of complex cells and a hypercomplex cell module (HCM) that simulates the edge and direction-sensitive properties of hypercomplex cells.The results show that on the UAV small object dataset VisDrone2019 and the remote sensing small object AITODv2, the network we designed achieved an accuracy index (mAP50) score of 48.9% and 49.1% with 1.3M parameters, successfully achieving a good balance between lightweight network and detection accuracy, achieving the best performance of lightweight models, and effectively reducing the occurrence of missed detections and false detections.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b96f7c06-b33b-4f16-a77b-3209d9cc297d)
